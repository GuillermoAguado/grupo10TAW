This repository was used for a practical exercise for subject "Tecnologías de Aplicaciones Web" (Web Application Technologies) during my Software Engineering studies at University of Málaga.

It is an application for creating and joining to events (much like Eventbrite). Depending on their role, users may organize events, join events or chat with event operators about events.
